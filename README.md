# **Tetris (NES, Nintendo remake)**

Tetris for Nintendo Entertainment System was released in November, 1989 in North America and published by Nintendo.

## **How NES Tetris works**

* Number of players: 1
* Next pieces: 1
* Play field dimensions: 10 x 20
* Hold piece: No
* Hard drop: No
* Wall kick: No
* Lock delay: No

## **Level system**

In Marathon called **A-TYPE**, when the player line clear (startLevel × 10 + 10) or max(100, (startLevel × 10 - 50)) lines, whatever comes first, the level advances by 1. After this, the level advances by 1 for every 10 lines.

## **Nintendo rotation system**

The rotation system is right-handed. Lock delay, wall kick and hard drop are not present.

## **Score system**

### **Line clear score**

This is a version of the BPS system with a level multiplier incorporated.

* 1 = 40
* 2 = 100
* 3 = 300
* 4 = 1200
* points = 40 * (level + 1)

## **Drop System**

Drop is the downward motion of tetrominos in Tetris games, and other games that use falling pieces. There are three different types of drops in Tetris.

### **Gravity Drop**

Gravity can be thought as an automatic drop. It moves a tetromino downward into the play field at a regular rate, which may change depending on the difficulty level, or progress the in the game. The tetromino move down a distance one block every so often.

### **Soft Drop**

Many games allow the player to temporarily increase the gravity by holding down a key, most often "down" on the directional pad or joystick. The tetromino will lock a soft-dropped piece as soon it lands.

For each piece, the game also awards the number of points equal to the number of grid spaces that the player has continuously soft dropped the piece. This does not increase per level.

### **Hard Drop**

Hard drop is an action that forces the piece land and lock instantly.
